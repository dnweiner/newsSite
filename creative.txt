For the creative portion, we created a way to search for stories based on their titles, a way to change user passwords, and a way to delete users.
The code for keyword searching (admittedly rudimentary, but workable) is found in search.php and uses wildcards on either side of the user's search terms for a LIKE statement of a query.
To change user passwords, we added a form on homepage.php that takes in a new password. This is passed to changepassword.php, where the password is encrypted and the users table of the database updated accordingly. This is a re-registering of sorts. The user is then authenticated again with their new password.
To delete a user, we simply delete from the users table where that userid is found (with a precautionary limit of 1).
